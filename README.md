# womenSquirirtAndroidApp

During my academic studies, I developed a women's security Android app using Flutter for the front end and PHP with MySQLi for the back end. The app provides safety features such as emergency alerts, location tracking, and real-time notifications. This project enhanced my skills in cross-platform mobile development, server-side scripting, and database management.
